# 0x0B. SSH

## DevOps | SSH | Network | SysAdmin | Security

### Background Context

In this project, you have been assigned an Ubuntu server located in a distant datacenter. Unlike the previous level, you'll connect using SSH but not via a password; instead, you'll use an RSA key. Your server is pre-configured with the public key from your previous task.

Access server information from the "My Servers" section of the intranet, providing IP and username for SSH connection.
