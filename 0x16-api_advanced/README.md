## Python Scripting Back-end API

### Background Context
APIs are a staple in technical interviews, with questions ranging from simple endpoint queries to complex recursive functions and data formatting. The Reddit API is a versatile tool for practice, offering numerous endpoints that often don't require authentication and a wealth of data to work with. Mastering API calls now can be a significant advantage in interviews and for personal projects.

### Resources
- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to read API documentation to locate desired endpoints.
- How to use an API with pagination.
- How to parse JSON results from an API.
- How to make a recursive API call.
- How to sort a dictionary by value.
