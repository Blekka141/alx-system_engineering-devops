# 0x11. What Happens When You Type google.com and Press Enter?

## Description

This project explores the detailed process that occurs from the moment you type a URL into your browser to when the page is displayed on your screen. This understanding is crucial for professionals in the fields of networking, systems administration, and DevOps. The focus will be on understanding the roles of DNS resolution, TCP/IP protocols, SSL/TLS for HTTPS, firewalls, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.

## Blog Post

I have written a comprehensive blog post that explains the sequence of events in detail. 

## Diagram

To visually represent the process described in the blog, I have created a diagram that shows each step from DNS resolution to the final rendering of the page. 

## Contribution

As part of a community effort to enhance the collective understanding of this process, I have contributed to an open-source project that aims to document it comprehensively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to explain the following without needing to refer to external resources:
- What is a DNS request and how is it handled?
- How does TCP/IP work in the context of web browsing?
- What are the functions of firewalls, SSL certificates, and HTTPS in web security?
- How do load balancers optimize resource use and enhance the user experience?
- What roles do web servers and application servers play in delivering content to the end-user?
- How do databases interact with other components in the web hosting environment?
