Task 3: Scale Up Web Infrastructure Diagram

Diagram Elements:

    Users: People accessing the website through their web browsers.
    DNS Query: Represents the process of translating www.foobar.com into the IP address of the primary load balancer.
    Primary Load Balancer (HAproxy): Directs incoming traffic to the web servers and is now part of a cluster with a secondary load balancer for high availability.
    Secondary Load Balancer (HAproxy): Acts as a backup to the primary load balancer, ready to take over in case of failure, ensuring continuous traffic management.
    Web Servers (Nginx): Dedicated servers for serving web content, potentially increased in number to distribute the load further.
    Application Servers: Separate servers for running application logic, improving the application's ability to handle more concurrent users.
    Database Servers (MySQL): Split into separate servers for handling writes (Primary) and reads (Replicas), enhancing database access and reliability.
    Firewalls: Positioned in front of each server group (web, application, database) to secure and control access.
    SSL Certificate: Ensures encrypted communication between the users and the web servers.
    Monitoring System: Expanded to cover all components comprehensively, monitoring performance, availability, and security.

Ensure your diagram clearly illustrates the expanded infrastructure, showing the enhanced pathways for traffic flow, dedicated resources for each component, and the redundancy measures in place.
Explanation for Each Component

    Additional Load Balancer: Introducing a second load balancer in a cluster configuration with the primary ensures no single point of failure in traffic management, enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup for high availability.

    Dedicated Servers for Each Component: Separating the web, application, and database layers onto their dedicated servers allows each component to be scaled independently based on demand, improving performance and reliability.

    Expanded Monitoring: With the infrastructure's complexity, a comprehensive monitoring solution is essential for proactive management, enabling quick detection and resolution of performance bottlenecks or failures.

Considerations

    Why Each Element Is Added: Discuss the rationale behind each new component or architectural decision, focusing on the benefits of separation of concerns, redundancy for high availability, and scalability.

    Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Load Balancing: Explain the choice between these two setups for the load balancers, considering factors like resource utilization, complexity, and failover time.

    Database Scalability: Address the strategies for scaling the database, such as sharding or replication, and the impact of these strategies on application architecture.

Issues with This Infrastructure

    Complexity: As the infrastructure grows, so does its complexity, potentially making management and troubleshooting more challenging.

    Cost: Scaling up involves additional hardware, software, and operational costs. It's important to balance performance and availability needs with budget constraints.

    Database Write Scalability: Even with read replicas, write operations can still become a bottleneck if the primary database server's capacity is exceeded.
