Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure Diagram

Diagram Elements:

    Users: Individuals accessing the website through their browsers.
    DNS Query: The process where users' browsers request the IP address of www.foobar.com.
    DNS Server: Resolves the domain name www.foobar.com to the IP address of the load balancer.
    Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic across the two web servers to balance load and enhance reliability.
    Web Servers (Nginx): Two servers configured to serve web content. They receive requests from the load balancer.
    Application Servers: Host the application logic. Each web server is connected to its own application server.
    Database (MySQL): A primary-replica setup where one database serves as the primary (master) node and the other as the replica (slave) node for redundancy and read scalability.

Ensure your diagram shows the flow from the user making a request through the DNS system, to the load balancer, and then to the servers, illustrating how responses are generated and sent back to the user.
Explanation for Each Component

    Additional Servers: Increases the infrastructure's capacity to handle high traffic and ensures redundancy, improving reliability and uptime.

    Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic among servers, enhancing the website's ability to handle more users simultaneously. It helps in achieving high availability by redirecting traffic in case one server fails.

    Distribution Algorithm: The method used by the load balancer to distribute traffic (e.g., round-robin, least connections). This choice affects how effectively the load is balanced across the servers.

    Active-Active vs. Active-Passive: In an Active-Active setup, all servers are handling traffic at the same time, maximizing resource utilization. In Active-Passive, one or more servers are on standby and only become active if the primary server(s) fail.

    Primary-Replica Database Cluster: Ensures data availability and load balancing for read operations. The primary node handles write operations, while the replica(s) handle read operations, improving read performance and serving as a backup in case the primary fails.

Issues with This Infrastructure

    Single Points of Failure (SPOF): Identify any components that, if they failed, would take down the entire system (e.g., the load balancer if there's only one without a backup).

    Security Issues: Without firewalls or encrypted connections (HTTPS), sensitive data could be at risk, and the system could be vulnerable to attacks.

    Lack of Monitoring: Without proper monitoring tools, it's difficult to detect and address performance bottlenecks, system failures, or security breaches in a timely manner.

Creating the Diagram

When creating your diagram:

    Use a diagramming tool where you can clearly represent each component and its interactions with others.
    Label each part of your infrastructure clearly.
    Show the direction of traffic flow and the relationship between different components (e.g., users to DNS, DNS to load balancer, load balancer to web servers, etc.)
