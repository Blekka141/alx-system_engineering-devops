# Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview

This project explores the fundamentals of web infrastructure design, covering a range of topics from simple web server configurations to complex, distributed architectures with enhanced security and monitoring. Through a series of tasks, we delve into designing scalable, reliable, and secure web infrastructures that support modern web applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and explain basic and advanced concepts of web infrastructure.
- Design web infrastructure to meet various scalability, reliability, and security needs.
- Distinguish between different types of web servers, application servers, and database systems.
- Implement best practices for DNS configuration, load balancing, and system monitoring.
- Address common challenges such as single points of failure (SPOF), downtime during deployment, and securing web traffic.

## Project Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

Design a basic web infrastructure using a LAMP stack but with Nginx as the web server. The setup involves a single server, highlighting the roles of a web server, application server, database, and the importance of DNS.

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

Enhance the web infrastructure by introducing additional servers and a load balancer. This setup aims to improve reliability and load distribution, featuring an Active-Active or Active-Passive load balancer configuration and a Primary-Replica database setup.

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

Advance the infrastructure's security and monitoring by adding firewalls, SSL/TLS encryption, and monitoring tools. This task focuses on securing data in transit, controlling access, and maintaining visibility into the health and performance of the web infrastructure.

### Task 3: Scale Up

Explore scaling strategies by further splitting components across servers and introducing redundancy at the load balancer level. This advanced task addresses scalability and reliability for growing web applications.

## Diagrams and Explanations

Each task includes a detailed diagram and an explanation of the web infrastructure designed. These materials are crafted to illustrate the decision-making process behind each component's inclusion and configuration, providing insights into building resilient web architectures.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to solidify understanding of web infrastructure components and their interactions. By tackling various design challenges, the goal is to prepare for designing and managing the infrastructure of scalable, secure, and efficient web applications.

## Quiz Answers
